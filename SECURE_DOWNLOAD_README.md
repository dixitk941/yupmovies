# Secure Download Implementation

## Overview
This implementation prevents direct exposure of download URLs by using a proxy approach that opens an intermediate page before redirecting to the actual download.

## How It Works

### Before (Insecure)
- Download button directly opened URLs like: `https://actual-download-server.com/movies/file.mp4`
- Users could see and copy the real download URLs
- Direct access to file servers

### After (Secure)
- Download button opens an intermediate redirect page
- The intermediate page shows a loading screen for 1.5 seconds
- Then automatically redirects to the actual download URL
- The window closes after starting the download
- Users cannot easily see or copy the real URLs

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`src/utils/secureDownload.js`** - New utility for secure downloads
2. **`src/pages/SeriesDetail.jsx`** - Updated to use secure download method
3. **`src/pages/MovieDetails.jsx`** - Updated to use secure download method

### Key Features
- **URL Obfuscation**: Real download URLs are hidden from users
- **Temporary Redirect Page**: Shows a professional loading screen
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Redirect window closes automatically
- **Fallback Support**: Falls back to direct download if popup is blocked
- **User-Friendly**: Shows download progress and information

### Security Benefits
- Prevents casual URL copying
- Reduces direct server access
- Makes it harder to script automated downloads
- Maintains professional appearance

### Usage Example
```javascript
import { handleSecureDownload } from '../utils/secureDownload';

// Instead of direct URL opening:
// window.open(downloadUrl, '_blank');

// Use secure download:
const success = handleSecureDownload(
  downloadUrl,           // The actual download URL
  'Movie Title',         // Display title
  '1080p',              // Quality info
  '2.5GB'               // File size (optional)
);
```

## User Experience
1. User clicks download button
2. New tab opens with loading screen showing:
   - "Preparing Download..."
   - Spinning loader
   - File title and quality
   - "This window will close automatically"
3. After 1.5 seconds, download starts automatically
4. Window closes after 1 second

## Testing
To test the secure download:
1. Click any download button in movies or series
2. Observe the intermediate loading page
3. Verify download starts automatically
4. Check that the real URL is not visible in the address bar

## Notes
- This is a simple client-side solution
- For production, consider server-side token-based downloads
- The 1.5-second delay prevents URL inspection while maintaining UX
- Works with all modern browsers
